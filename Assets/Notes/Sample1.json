My name was Dr. Lian Harper. I worked at the CDC, specifically on neurodegenerative diseases. I'm writing this on September 14, 2029. I don't know how much time I have left. My mind is still mostly intact—for now. But the signs are here. Slurred speech. Tremors. Gaps in memory. It's all progressing fast. Much faster than any prion disease we've ever seen.

We called it Variant PrP-Ω. It started with a few isolated cases—seizures, dementia, personality changes. At first, we thought it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. But the incubation period was too short. Mere weeks. Then it spread.

We never figured out the original source. Maybe it was synthetic—engineered, released intentionally or accidentally. Some believe it came from contaminated meat, others from a mutated lab strain. A few even claimed it emerged spontaneously—nature playing dice. None of that mattered in the end. The prions were airborne. That was the breakthrough, or the death sentence. Never seen before.

Airborne misfolded proteins. Invisible. Indestructible. They passed from person to person like a cold, but they didn’t just make you sick—they unmade your brain. They turned your own proteins against you. A slow self-destruction. Some resisted longer than others. A few were born immune. But even they didn’t last. Society collapsed in under a year.

The power grid failed a few months ago. Governments fell before that. The cities went quiet. Not peaceful—just… hollow. Most of the infected wandered until they lost motor control. Some became violent, either from fear or damage to the frontal cortex. I don’t know what happened in rural areas. We lost all contact.

I stayed here, in Atlanta. Kept working. Or trying to. We had a team, at first. Now it’s just me. I’ve been injecting myself with experimental stabilizers. They bought me time. But not enough.

I’ve locked away the research. If you’re something intelligent—something capable of decoding human language—then maybe it’ll mean something to you. It’s in the terminal marked “Ω-Archive” in the sub-basement of this facility. You’ll need to bypass security protocols, but you probably don’t care about our firewalls.

Please, study what we left behind. Understand how prions work. What they can do. And if there are others out there—other sentient species, on other worlds—warn them. Life is fragile. Intelligence is no shield. We created things we didn’t understand, and by the time we knew it was a mistake, it was already replicating faster than we could respond.

I don’t know if anything human will remain after this. Not in any meaningful way.

But maybe memory is enough.

If you’re out there—remember us.
