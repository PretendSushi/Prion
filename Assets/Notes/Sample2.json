	"content": "If anyone finds this, then you're either a survivor… or something that came after.\n\nMy name is Eva Moreno. I was a history teacher. I liked books, quiet mornings, and peanut butter on toast. I guess none of that matters anymore. But I need to write this down. Not for me. For whoever comes next.\n\nIt started small. Doesn't it always?\n\nFirst, people were just… forgetful. Little things. Names. Where they left their keys. Then came the shaking, the twitching, the screaming. They called it a “prion anomaly” on the news—like giving it a name made it less terrifying.\n\nIt wasn't a virus. Not something you could fight with pills or prayers. It was our own biology turning traitor. A misfolded protein that taught other proteins how to misfold. Like a whisper in your brain, teaching every cell how to die quietly. And worse—it could spread through the air.\n\nWe were so smart. Thought we had conquered nature. Built satellites, AI, space stations. But in the end, a single wrong fold of a protein was all it took. Not even alive, just... bad instructions.\n\nEverything fell apart in less than a year. Schools shut down. Stores emptied. People stopped trusting each other. If you coughed, even once, you were as good as dead—either from the disease, or from fear.\n\nMy family didn’t make it. First my husband, then my daughter. I was immune. Or maybe just lucky. There were a few of us at first. We thought we could rebuild. Start over. But the world wasn't waiting for us to catch up. Fires burned unchecked. Systems failed. And loneliness did what the prion couldn’t.\n\nIt’s quiet now. Not peaceful. Just empty. I walk sometimes, through the streets. I see the bones. The collapsed buildings. Moss eating the edges of what we once called civilization. Nature is already moving on, growing through the cracks.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll last much longer. I feel tired. Not infected—just... done.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you're not human, I hope you’re better than we were. Kinder. Wiser. Maybe you’ll look at our ruins and understand what we were trying to do. We had so much beauty in us. Music. Laughter. Dreams. But we were also afraid. So afraid.\n\nPlease don’t make the same mistakes.\n\nThis journal is under the ash tree behind the old city library, wrapped in plastic and tin. Maybe others left notes too. Maybe you’ll piece us together, page by page.\n\nWe mattered. Even if we were short-lived, we mattered.\n\n—Eva",
